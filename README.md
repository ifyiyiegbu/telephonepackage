# telephonepackage

To practice JavaScript design patterns, we have created a telephone class that has 3 methods namely:

- AddPhoneNumber
- RemovePhoneNumber
- DialPhoneNumber

Three other methods have been added to the telephone class to update it to an observer pattern. The methods include:

- addObserver
- deleteObserver
- notifyObserver

The telephone class notifies the observers whenever a phone number is dialed.
